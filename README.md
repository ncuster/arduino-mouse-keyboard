# arduino-mouse
Sketch for using an arduino, joystick, two push buttons, all to simulate a mouse and keyboard on an Arduino Micro.

Pressing the left button
- once puts the arduino/joystick in mouse mode
- twice puts it in keyboard mode to send a, w, s, d keys for using the joystick for navigating common computer-based games.  
- three times turns off mouse and keyboard functionality.

This has been used as an adaptive device for people with various disabilities.
